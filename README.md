## Future Improvements

To improve the application we can:
- Add other filtering options such as programming languages or keywords from the Repository's description.
- Consuming the GitHub API to fetch the user's projects and packages and display them inside the application.

## Reflection

This was a 1 week long project built In the Frame of a Coding Challenge. Project goals included using React Js as a technology learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

I really appreciated the challenge, I felt free to choose the Interface design and to practice my technical knowledge.
Due to project time constraints, I had to focus more on repositories data visualization from the API and implementing the Search functionality by filtering the user's repos.
